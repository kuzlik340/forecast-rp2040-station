# forecast-rp2040-station

## Introduction

The forecast-rp2040-station is a project based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller. It aims to provide a compact and efficient meteorological station capable of monitoring and displaying temperature and atmospheric pressure. This station displays real-time data on graphics and provides users with a forecast for 10 hours ahead by simply comparing pressures.


## Functionality

The forecast-rp2040-station offers the following features:

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the ambient temperature. Also every 17 minutes there will be an update of the graphic on temperature.
- **Pressure Measurement**: Measures atmospheric pressure. Also doing a graphic out of it.
- **Forecast feature**: The main feature of this station is forecast based on the atmospheric pressure.
